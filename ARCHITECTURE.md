# Architecture Documentation

## System Overview

The Shopify Data Ingestion & Insights Service is designed as a multi-tenant SaaS platform that enables enterprise retailers to connect their Shopify stores and gain actionable insights from their customer data.

## Architecture Principles

### 1. Multi-Tenancy
- **Tenant Isolation**: Each Shopify store operates as a separate tenant with isolated data
- **Shared Infrastructure**: Common codebase and infrastructure with tenant-specific configurations
- **Scalable Design**: Architecture supports adding new tenants without code changes

### 2. Event-Driven Architecture
- **Webhook Integration**: Real-time data ingestion through Shopify webhooks
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Non-blocking webhook processing with error handling
- **Event Logging**: Comprehensive logging for debugging and audit trails

### 3. Security-First Design
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with role-based access control
- **Data Protection**: Tenant data isolation and secure API endpoints
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation and sanitization

## System Components

### Backend Services

#### 1. Authentication Service (`/routes/auth.js`)
- JWT token generation and validation
- User registration and login
- Role-based access control (admin/user)
- Password hashing with bcrypt

#### 2. Webhook Service (`/routes/webhooks.js`)
- Shopify webhook signature verification
- Multi-tenant webhook routing
- Data transformation and validation
- Error handling and logging

#### 3. Data API Service (`/routes/api.js`)
- Analytics data aggregation
- Pagination and filtering
- Multi-tenant data access
- Performance optimization

#### 4. Tenant Management (`/routes/tenants.js`)
- Tenant CRUD operations
- Configuration management
- Admin-only operations
- Tenant statistics

### Database Layer

#### Schema Design
```sql
-- Multi-tenant isolation through tenant_id foreign keys
tenants (id, name, shopify_domain, credentials, ...)
users (id, email, tenant_id, role, ...)
customers (id, tenant_id, shopify_customer_id, ...)
orders (id, tenant_id, customer_id, ...)
products (id, tenant_id, shopify_product_id, ...)
```

#### Data Relationships
- **One-to-Many**: Tenant → Users, Customers, Orders, Products
- **Many-to-One**: Orders → Customer, Order Line Items → Product
- **Audit Trail**: Webhook logs for debugging and compliance

### Frontend Architecture

#### Component Structure
```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── Auth/           # Authentication components
│   └── Dashboard/      # Dashboard components
├── contexts/           # React contexts (Auth)
└── App.js             # Main application router
```

#### State Management
- **React Context**: Authentication state management
- **Local State**: Component-specific state with hooks
- **API Integration**: RESTful API calls with error handling

## Data Flow

### 1. Webhook Data Ingestion
```
Shopify Store → Webhook → Verification → Tenant Resolution → Database → Response
```

### 2. Dashboard Analytics
```
User Request → Authentication → API Endpoint → Database Query → Data Aggregation → Response
```

### 3. Multi-Tenant Data Access
```
API Request → JWT Validation → Tenant Extraction → Data Filtering → Response
```

## Security Architecture

### Authentication Flow
1. User submits credentials
2. Server validates against database
3. JWT token generated with user/tenant info
4. Token included in subsequent requests
5. Middleware validates token and extracts context

### Data Isolation
- All database queries include tenant_id filtering
- API endpoints validate user access to tenant data
- Admin users can access cross-tenant data

### Webhook Security
- Shopify HMAC signature verification
- Rate limiting on webhook endpoints
- Comprehensive logging for security monitoring

## Performance Considerations

### Database Optimization
- Indexed columns for frequent queries (tenant_id, created_at)
- Pagination for large datasets
- Efficient aggregation queries for analytics

### API Performance
- Response caching opportunities
- Batch operations for bulk data
- Asynchronous processing for heavy operations

### Frontend Optimization
- Component lazy loading
- Efficient re-rendering with React hooks
- Optimized bundle size

## Scalability Strategy

### Horizontal Scaling
- Stateless API design enables load balancing
- Database connection pooling
- Microservices architecture preparation

### Vertical Scaling
- Efficient database queries
- Memory optimization
- CPU-intensive task optimization

## Monitoring & Observability

### Logging Strategy
- Structured logging with correlation IDs
- Webhook processing logs
- Error tracking and alerting

### Metrics Collection
- API response times
- Database query performance
- User activity analytics

### Health Checks
- Database connectivity
- External service dependencies
- System resource utilization

## Deployment Architecture

### Development Environment
- Local SQLite database
- Hot reloading for development
- Comprehensive error logging

### Production Considerations
- PostgreSQL/MySQL for production database
- Redis for caching and sessions
- Container orchestration (Docker/Kubernetes)
- CDN for static assets

## API Design Patterns

### RESTful Conventions
- Standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Consistent response formats
- Proper status codes

### Error Handling
- Standardized error response format
- Detailed error messages for development
- Generic messages for production security

### Pagination
- Cursor-based pagination for large datasets
- Consistent pagination metadata
- Configurable page sizes

## Future Architecture Enhancements

### Microservices Migration
1. **Authentication Service**: Dedicated auth microservice
2. **Data Ingestion Service**: Webhook processing service
3. **Analytics Service**: Data aggregation and reporting
4. **Notification Service**: Real-time notifications

### Event Sourcing
- Event store for audit trails
- CQRS pattern for read/write separation
- Event replay capabilities

### Real-time Features
- WebSocket integration for live updates
- Server-sent events for notifications
- Real-time dashboard updates

## Technology Stack Rationale

### Backend Choices
- **Node.js**: JavaScript ecosystem, async I/O, rapid development
- **Express.js**: Minimal, flexible web framework
- **SQLite**: Simple setup, ACID compliance, sufficient for MVP

### Frontend Choices
- **React**: Component-based architecture, large ecosystem
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS, rapid UI development
- **Chart.js**: Comprehensive charting library (custom implementation)

### Security Choices
- **JWT**: Stateless authentication, scalable
- **bcrypt**: Industry-standard password hashing
- **Helmet**: Security headers middleware

This architecture provides a solid foundation for a multi-tenant Shopify analytics platform while maintaining flexibility for future enhancements and scaling requirements.
